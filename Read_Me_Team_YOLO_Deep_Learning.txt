# Deep learning neuron network model to predict target variable
This code contains cleaning, mining, deep learning model building, deep learning model tuning, and deep learning model evaluation for airplane customer satisfaction analysis.
This code is built for deep learning model.
The first goal of this project is to help the airplane company understand what factors affect customer satisfcation

## Getting Started


1. Download "train.csv" and "test.csv" from "https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction?select=train.csv"

2. Use Google Colaboratory to open script: Deep_Learning_Model_by_Team_YOLO.ipynb


### Prerequisites


What things you need to run the software
